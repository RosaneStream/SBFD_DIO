            I am a Brazilian professional, graduated in IT by Universidade Positivo and MBA in Executive Management by FAE Business/Baldwin Wallace University. In addition, I'm always earning new tools, currently Power Platform.

            My experience includes:
            System development, managing the entire lifecycle, such as requirement analysis, design, coding, testing, documentation support procedures; Stakeholders relationship; BPM (business process management); Corporate Risk Management, such as assessment and reviewing internal controls, as well as corporate insurance management, in order to ensure compliance with applicable rules and regulations.
            
            Portuguese is my first language; English is a work in progress (advanced level). I attended to a ESL Program for 3 months in California. Additionally, I spent 6 months travelling around other States of USA. Frequently, I practice English conversation with some friends and teach Portuguese to others who speak English. 
            
            Main soft skills I keep are organization, time management and accountability, analytical and creative thinking, keeping core values such as empathy, transparency, efficiency and collaboration.
            
            Good music, listening, singing and playing the guitar, is my favorite therapy. It renews my mind and recharges my daily strength.  Also, I like to spend my free time learning new skills and helping my neighbors' children with their schoolwork, especially math and language.
            
            I really appreciated the last company I worked for.  It made me feel safe in times of crisis.  However, I could find new challenges, working from home or from anywhere.  My ideal goal is to help teams with a positive mood, where I can continue learning while developing solutions, skills and competences.
